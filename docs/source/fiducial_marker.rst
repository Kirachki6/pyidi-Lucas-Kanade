Fiducial Marker-Based Motion Tracking and Compensation
======================================================

This `Showcase <https://github.com/ladisk/pyidi/blob/master/examples/Showcase_fiducial.ipynb>`_ demonstrates the fiducial marker-based motion tracking and compensation capabilities of **pyIDI**.

The example dataset originates from infrared-spectrum measurements. For convenience and to meet GitHub storage limits, the original data was undersampled to create a 25-frame video. The package can also process visible-range acquisitions.
